# Data Science Project Ideas for Freshers

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Dataset: Choose a dataset of interest and perform thorough EDA to extract insights, visualize trends, and identify patterns.

Predictive Modeling: Build a simple predictive model, such as linear regression, to predict a target variable based on input features. Use libraries like scikit-learn to implement the model.

Classification Problem: Work on a classification task using algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines. It could involve classifying emails as spam or not spam, or predicting customer churn.

Time Series Analysis: Analyze time-dependent data, like stock prices or temperature readings, to forecast future values using techniques like ARIMA or LSTM.

Image Classification: Use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to build an image classification model, perhaps classifying different types of objects or animals.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Create a sentiment analysis model that classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral, or build a text generator using recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Clustering Analysis: Apply clustering algorithms like k-means to group similar data points together, such as segmenting customers based on purchasing behaviour.

Recommendation System: Develop a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering techniques to suggest products or content to users.

Anomaly Detection: Build a model to detect anomalies in data, which could be useful for fraud detection or identifying defects in manufacturing processes.

A/B Testing: Design and analyze an A/B test to compare the effectiveness of two different versions of a web page or app feature.

Remember to document your process, explain your methodology, and showcase your projects on platforms like GitHub or a personal portfolio website.
